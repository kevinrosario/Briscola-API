# Briscola-API

Briscola is a web game developed for the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project also uses Bootstrap framework and jQuery library. This is the back-end for the [Briscola client](https://github.com/kevinrosario/Briscola-Client) and it's built on  the Ruby on Rails framework. This API can be accessed using this [link](https://briscola-api.herokuapp.com/) but it won't work because the access is restricted to the client only.

## How to use it

The game can be played using this [link](https://kevinrosario.github.io/Briscola-Client/). Please don't sign-up using a real email and password!

## Development process

I invested around 50 hours in this project. The most important thing I did was to whiteboard my problems before trying to code a solution. That gave me a clear sight of what I wanted and what I needed before trying to solve the problem without any path to follow. I started this project creating a RESTful API and then finished creating this front end.

## Technologies used

1. Ruby
2. Rails framework

## User-Stories

1. As a player, I want to choose a card from my hand and play it so that I can win.
2. As a player, I want to be able to see my stats and the amount of games that I've
   won so that I can presume it with my friends.
3. As a player, I want to be able to play against friends or the computer so the game
   gets challenging and amusing.
4. As a creator, I want people to enjoy my creation and have a great time playing
   something that might bring old memories back.

## Unsolved problems

1. I would like to add an algorithm to make the computer choose the best available card.
